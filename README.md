<h3>Why all this? - there are so many CMS around...</h3>
YaWK is an open source project, <b>built for everyone.</b> Actually there is <i>no big business company or foundation behind it - (yet!)</i> At the moment it is still <i>(mainly)</i> a one man show, - exclusively developed for my own, personal purpose. I started this project because I was not satisfied with all other solutions. So I took the challenge and started developing an overall tool that fits my personal needs. Originally it was not meant to public. But the bigger the project growed, the more people told me to make it accessable to the public crowd.
After spending a lot of my lifetime on this project, I decided to follow my friends - I've uploaded it to GitHub and kept the repository private until the status of the project has got to a level where others can make use out of it. Though all efforts of "getting it to the point", this project is not finished yet - and never will be. It will stay in development, as long as I or somebody else take care about it.
