<h3>Open Development</h3>
YaWK is an open source project, <b>built for everyone.</b> Actually there is <i>no big business company or foundation behind it</i>. It is mostly a one man show, - originally developed for my own, personal purpose. It was never meant to go public. But the bigger the project growed, the more people told me to make it accessable for the public crowd. 

After spending years on this project, I decided to follow my fellows - I've uploaded it to GitHub and kept the repository private until the status of the project has got to a level where people can make use out of it. Though all efforts of "getting it to the point", this project is not finished yet - and never will be. It will stay in development, as long as I or somebody else take care about it.

<h3>Funding and Crowd Help</h3>
Developing a big tool like this takes truely a certain amount of time. Most of the time I am working on it from eight to twelve hours per day. This is needed, to get a full-working product, not just a prototype. There are so many things implemented yet. You can watch the feature list here: http://yawk.io/features but a lot more is still ahead. Please overview upcoming goals here: http://roadmap.yawk.io

<h4>Help me get to the goals of this lifetime-project</h4>
To be able to keep developing this project all day (and all night) long, it was needed to kick my daily job. Developing this is a full-time job. As everyone else, I need to earn money to achieve my life. <b>Donating to this project will help me feed the hungry family members and make me able to take care and achieve the goals of this project.</b> I like to hold on to 'doing what I really like to' but without financial help I won't be able to keep on doing this on long-term sight. Therefore, I'll appreciate your help.

So please if you can, take a overview at the funding platform: http://funding.yawk.io and get more Information how you can contribute to this project. Your help keep this project alive and active.

<h2>What do we go now?</h2>
<h3>Feature Overview</h3>
<h4>Responsive Design</h4>
Think of responsive design as a matter of quality. The frontend, as well as the backend is 100% responsive designed. It does not matter if you are using it on a small handheld device, a desktop or even a big TV screen - it always acts nice and fit into the used device. In the past few years it's been tested during development, as well as on productional sites with more than 800+ smartphones, tablets, desktop and browser combinations & we keep on testing!

<h4>Boostrap Customization <small>re-design boostrap with 'click + see'</small></h4>
The Template Engine allows you to easily change the most important Bootstrap settings comfortable with a few clicks. You can instantly overview the changes in your frontend after you made them. When you hit the save button, a custom.css with your settings gets written. This system allows you to change Typography, Navbars, Forms, Buttons, Colors... and more with just a few clicks. You don't need to search, find and replace and swim through some of the 8000+ lines of bootstrap CSS code, just to change a few settings. With YaWK, you can do it fluid while working on your project and keep your flow. And wouldn't this be cool enough - you are allowed to save your own bootstrap design settings as new theme to use or re-use a modified version for any YaWK project you like. Cool, isn't it?
