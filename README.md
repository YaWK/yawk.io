<u><b>Please remember:</b></u> before you download this pre-release version: YaWK is currently in active development and <b>NOT YET RELEASED</b>.

<br><b>https://github.com/YaWK/yawk.io/archive/refs/heads/master.zip</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
Before YaWK will be officially released, you will always get the current development version. After the first version is officially released, there will be a seperate development branch. You should wait for the official first release before you use YaWK in productive environment. I'm happy about comments, stars, followers and / or code contributions. Thank You!

<h3>üîß Setup / Installation</h3>
There are two ways to load YaWK on your webserver:<br><br>
<ol>
<li><u>If you have root/shell access:</u> <b>git clone https://github.com/YaWK/yawk.io</b>
    <br><br>
    or
    if you are using composer you can type: <b>composer create yawk/yawk.io -s dev</b>
    <br><br>
    <i>(afterwards move files from yawk.io folder to your project's root directory if necessary.)</i>
    <br><br>
ATTENTION: Files must be accessible by webserver user & group. Make sure to check/set correct user/group permissions (example: chown -R www-data:www-data yourfolder)
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
    <u>If you're using a webhost:</u> Download the .zip package, extract it on your computer and upload the extracted files to your webserver. Use any FTP client and upload the files to the root directory of your webserver.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Minimum Server / Web-hosting Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
<li>PHP 8.x is required</li>
<li>MySQL 5.x or higher (MariaDB works also)</li>
<li>Apache 2.x or nginx Webserver</li>
<li>MOD_REWRITE enabled</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation / Setup HowTo</h3>
When YaWK is uploaded to your webserver, simply call www.yourwebsite.tld in your browser. If the server is correctly configured, you will see step 1/5 of the setup process. The installation guide you through 5 steps and is pretty self-explanatory.<br>

<h3>üê£ But why?! - there are so many good CMS around...</h3>
YaWK is an open source project, <b>built for everyone.</b> Actually there is <i>no big business company or foundation behind it - (yet!)</i> At the moment it is still <i>(mainly)</i> a one man show, - exclusively developed for my own, personal purpose. I started this project because I was not satisfied with all other solutions. So I took the challenge and started developing an overall tool that fits my personal needs. Originally it was not meant to public. But the bigger the project growed, the more people told me to make it accessable to the public crowd.
After spending a lot of my lifetime on this project, I decided to follow my friends - I've uploaded it to GitHub and kept the repository private until the status of the project has got to a level where others can make use out of it. Though all efforts of "getting it to the point", this project is not finished yet - and never will be. It will stay in development, as long as I or somebody else take care about it.
