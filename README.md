<h4>Feature Overview</h4>

<h5>Responsive Design</h5>
Think of responsive design as a matter of quality. The frontend, as well as the backend is 100% responsive designed. It does not matter if you are using it on a small handheld device, a desktop or even a big TV screen - it always acts nice and fit into the used device. In the past few years it's been tested during development, as well as on productional sites with more than 800+ smartphones, tablets, desktop and browser combinations & we keep on testing!

<h5>Boostrap Customization <small>re-design boostrap with 'click + see'</small></h5>
The Template Engine allows you to easily change the most important Bootstrap settings comfortable with a few clicks. You can instantly overview the changes in your frontend after you made them. When you hit the save button, a custom.css with your settings gets written. This system allows you to change Typography, Navbars, Forms, Buttons, Colors... and more with just a few clicks. You don't need to search, find and replace and swim through some of the 8000+ lines of bootstrap CSS code, just to change a few settings. With YaWK, you can do it fluid while working on your project and keep your flow. And wouldn't this be cool enough - you are allowed to save your own bootstrap design settings as new theme to use or re-use a modified version for any YaWK project you like. Cool, isn't it?
