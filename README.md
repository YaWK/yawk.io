<h3>Open Development</h3>
YaWK is an open source project, <b>built for everyone.</b> Actually there is <i>no big business company or foundation behind it</i>. It is mostly a one man show, - originally developed for my own, personal purpose. It was never meant to go public. But the bigger the project growed, the more people told me to make it accessable to the public crowd. 

After spending years on this project, I decided to follow my fellows - I've uploaded it to GitHub and kept the repository private until the status of the project has got to a level where people can make use out of it. Though all efforts of "getting it to the point", this project is not finished yet - and never will be. It will stay in development, as long as I or somebody else take care about it.
