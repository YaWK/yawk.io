First of all: thank you! It's great that you think about how to improve 
YaWK. Please check, if your problem was already issued or discussed before

problem,</i> you can open a new issue here.

<br><b>If you want to report a problem:</b><br>
<i>Please be sure to include a title and a clear description of what you 
want to fix / add / improve and why this should happen. Write
as much relevant information as possible to help others to get a clue of your idea.</i>

<b>Did you wrote code that fixes a bug, improved existing code or added a new feature?</b>
<ul>
<li>
Open a new GitHub pull request containing your code.
</li>
<li>
Ensure that the Pull request description clearly describes 
the problem and your solution. Include the relevant issue number 
if applicable.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?</b>
<br>
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial 
to the stability, functionality, or testability of YaWK will 
generally not be accepted.
<br><br>
<b>Do you have questions about the source code?</b><br>
Ask any question about the use of YaWK on our support page. 
<br><i>(support page is work in progress - coming soon)</i>
<br><br>
<b>Do you need further assistance?</b>
<br>If you experience any problems or having any suggestions, you are invited 
to open a trouble ticket on our support page. This will help the project to grow 
the way YOU (and possible others) need it. For sure, it is not possible to answer 
every single question and solve every problem for free, but sending a trouble ticket
it's worth a try and cost nothing but your time.
